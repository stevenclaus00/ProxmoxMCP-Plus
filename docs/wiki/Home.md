# ProxmoxMCP-Plus Wiki

This wiki is the longer-form documentation hub for ProxmoxMCP-Plus.

ProxmoxMCP-Plus gives you one Proxmox VE control surface for both:

- MCP clients such as Claude Desktop and Open WebUI
- HTTP and OpenAPI consumers such as dashboards, internal tools, and automation jobs

Use the root `README.md` for the fast project overview. Use this wiki when you need setup detail, operating guidance, security notes, or tool-by-tool reference material.

## What The Project Covers

- VM and LXC lifecycle operations
- snapshots, rollback, backup, and restore
- ISO and template workflows
- cluster, node, and storage inspection
- SSH-backed container command execution
- persistent job tracking with retry, cancel, and audit history
- OpenAPI bridging for the MCP tool surface

## Architecture Summary

- `main.py` starts the MCP server entrypoint
- `src/proxmox_mcp/server.py` registers MCP tools
- `src/proxmox_mcp/openapi_proxy.py` exposes `/`, `/docs`, `/openapi.json`, `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/health`, `/metrics`, and `/jobs`
- `src/proxmox_mcp/config/` validates configuration and runtime settings
- `src/proxmox_mcp/security/command_policy.py` applies allow and deny rules for execution requests
- `src/proxmox_mcp/services/jobs.py` persists long-running job state in SQLite
- `docs/container-command-execution.md` explains the SSH-backed LXC command path

## Validation Summary

The repository includes live-environment verification entry points for:

- VM create, start, stop, and delete
- snapshot create, rollback, and delete
- backup and restore
- ISO download and cleanup
- LXC create, start, stop, and delete
- container SSH-backed command execution
- container authorized_keys update
- local OpenAPI `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/health`, and schema
- Docker image build and `/livez`

Primary validation entry points:

- `pytest -q --cov=proxmox_mcp --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=70`
- `ruff check .`
- `mypy src --ignore-missing-imports`
- `pip-audit -r requirements.txt`
- `tests/integration/test_real_contract.py`
- `tests/scripts/run_real_e2e.py`
